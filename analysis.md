# 404 Error Analysis

## Root Cause Identified

The 404 error occurs because this is a Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router with BrowserRouter, but the deployment platform (Vercel) doesn't have proper configuration to handle client-side routing.

## The Problem

1. **Client-Side Routing**: The app uses React Router's BrowserRouter which creates routes like `/dashboard` that only exist on the client side
2. **Server-Side Request**: When a user logs in, Clerk redirects to `/dashboard` with `redirectUrl="/dashboard"`
3. **Missing Server Configuration**: Vercel receives a request for `/dashboard` but there's no actual `/dashboard` file or folder
4. **404 Response**: Vercel returns a 404 because it can't find the requested resource

## Why It Works When Manually Navigating

- When you manually click on dashboard links, React Router handles the navigation client-side without making a server request
- The SPA is already loaded, so React Router can handle the route change internally

## Why It Fails After Login

- After login, there's a full page redirect (server-side redirect) to `/dashboard`
- This makes a fresh HTTP request to the server for `/dashboard`
- The server doesn't know about client-side routes and returns 404

## Solution Required

Need to configure Vercel to serve the main `index.html` file for all routes that don't match static assets, allowing React Router to handle the routing client-side.
